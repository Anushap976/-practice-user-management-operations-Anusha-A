In this project, I worked on strengthening my SQL skills by interacting with a MySQL database. The tasks I focused on included:

Created schemas and tables with specified columns using MySQL workbench.
Adding new user records to the database.
Modifying existing entries based on specific conditions.
Removing certain rows from the table.
Writing SELECT statements to retrieve data with specific filters, sorting, and limits.

This exercise helped me gain more confidence in using SQL, especially with the commands INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. One of the more challenging aspects was ensuring that the WHERE clause 
was correctly used to avoid unintentional updates or deletions.

All the SQL queries are contained in the file sql-practice.sql, where each query is clearly commented and organized by task.
